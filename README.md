An extended clipboard with history (under development)

About:
Hi this is Dave, I have a DotNet C# background and a few applications.
So I needed to do a first RUST project and I already had ***a beta C# based Windows clipboard*** whose main feature is extracting all links automatically.
It was really handly ***if*** that's on top of a history and with categories and edit functionality that would be great. That's the goal here.

By explaining that I'm doing direct code conversion, it will hopely help make what's here more coherent.
Importantly! This is my first full project; I'm a student. There is err... left over code from exercises I did.
Apologies. I'll clean it up and would really appreciate any sort of code review.

GOALS:
1. I am evaluating how to convert idiomatic C# to idomatic RUST although other languages (2) are important personally.
Note: This is the TL;DR explanation.
2. I want this little clipboard to have the power of code and data conversion libraries I have in C# and PICK at a minimum as I need it. So perhaps open source them.
3. In achiving that I will be able to automagically covert a rather large proprieatary app I own. The library attached to the clipboard is what's important. The snipets, widgets, add-ins (what have you) that could manipulate clipboard text. This has use cases outside of developers.
4. Have fun. I'm really enjoying learning rust. I hope..., time allowing (I gotta eat LOL), be able to:
5. Create a styling guide for C# (and so the .net languages), a discussion in the community and possibly including design patterns.
6. RUST is going to be a first class language at Microsoft in my view. This uses (trivally) their extensive OS crates (not the UI).

THE COMMUNITY:
* Any power user appreciates having a good clipboard.
* Optimized compile time using Features and a component based approach. Make it dev friendly.
* It's a use case for evaluating UI crates like Egui, EFrame and several others.
* An analysis, review and case study for convert .net C# is of broad interest.
* There are other people and publishers (businesses) like myself wanting to move to RUST. It adds adoption?
* I'd like to know how OS interaction with Linux and Windows both an option. What is idiomatic cross-platform coding?

Enjoy! Dave H.
